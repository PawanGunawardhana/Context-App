1. /**********Context API*******/
clean& easy way to share state between components without having to pass props down all the time.

/*********Hooks********/
Tap into the inner workings of react in functional components .We can do bunch of stuff inside functional components that we can normally only do inside class components.

When we use them together context and hooks they gonna allow us to work with shared data inside our application similar to how redux behaves.

2.Context API 
gives us a way to share state up and down a component tree quite easily.
we can do this without a context api by using props but eka patta wadayakne ape component trees and application godak large unama..
